---

## Executive Summary

### Core Concept

**Firewall** is a 2D endless runner where players control a nerdy hacker sprinting through an infinite digital corridor, dodging laser security systems and collecting valuable data diamonds. The unique twist: each diamond collected triggers a real coding challenge that must be solved to secure the score. Fail to dodge a laser, and you'll face a quick-time event to disarm the alarm—or lose everything. It's Temple Run meets LeetCode in a high-stakes cybersecurity heist.

### Target Audience

**Primary:** CS students and aspiring developers (18-25) who enjoy skill-based games and want to practice coding in an engaging format

**Secondary:** Casual gamers interested in learning programming concepts through fast-paced, addictive gameplay

## Core Gameplay

### Game Pillars

1. **Speed & Reflexes** - Fast auto-scrolling demands split-second timing for jumping and sliding through laser patterns
2. **Algorithmic Mastery** - Coding challenges pause the action, rewarding clean solutions with continued progress
3. **Risk vs Reward** - Diamond tiers (White/Blue/Black) offer different point values; harder challenges = bigger scores
4. **Second Chances** - Quick-time events provide dramatic recovery opportunities, keeping players in flow state longer
5. **Endless Pursuit** - No finish line—only personal bests and leaderboard domination drive replayability

### Core Gameplay Loop

**Primary Loop (Variable duration):**

1. **Auto-Run Through Corridor** (Continuous) - Player character sprints forward at constant speed, camera follows
2. **Dodge Laser Obstacles** (1-3s reaction windows) - Jump over low lasers, slide under high lasers using precise timing
3. **Collect Diamond** (Instant) - Run into floating diamond to trigger coding challenge; game pauses
4. **Solve Coding Challenge** (Untimed) - Code editor appears with difficulty-appropriate problem; player writes JavaScript solution
5. **Resume Running** (Instant) - Diamond secured to score, speed gradually increases, new obstacles spawn
6. **Laser Collision → QTE** (3-5s window) - If player hits laser, quick-time event triggers; match key sequence to disarm alarm or fail and lose run

**Recovery Mechanic:**

When player collides with laser:
1. Game pauses, alarm animation plays
2. Random key sequence displays (e.g., ← ↑ → A S D)
3. Player has 3-5 seconds to replicate pattern exactly
4. **Success:** Brief invincibility, continue run with all diamonds intact
5. **Failure:** Run ends, final score calculated, return to main menu

### Win/Loss Conditions

**Victory Conditions:**

- **Endless Mode:** No true "win"—success measured by leaderboard ranking
- **High Score Run:** Achieve personal best distance or weighted diamond score
- **Milestone Achievements:** Reach distance thresholds (e.g., 1000m, 5000m, 10000m)

**Failure States:**

- **QTE Failure:** Failed to disarm alarm after laser collision—run ends immediately
- **Fall Off Screen:** Player falls below screen bounds (rare edge case)
- **Voluntary Quit:** Player can pause and abandon run (score not submitted)

## Game Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

#### **Auto-Scrolling Runner**

**Description:** The player character automatically runs forward at increasing speed. The camera follows, and the environment scrolls continuously from right to left. Player has no control over horizontal movement—only vertical (jump/slide).

**Player Input:**
- No horizontal movement control (auto-scroll)
- Vertical actions only (jump/slide)
- Passive collection of diamonds by collision

**System Response:**
- Constant forward velocity (increases over time/distance)
- Parallax scrolling background for depth perception
- Speed multiplier increases every 500m traveled
- Obstacle spawn rate scales with speed

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Phaser's built-in velocity system for smooth scrolling
- Camera follows player with fixed X offset
- Spawn obstacles at edge of screen based on timer + speed
- Parallax layers: background (0.3x), midground (0.6x), foreground (1x)

**Performance Consideration:** Object pooling for obstacles and diamonds to prevent garbage collection lag

**Dependencies:** Obstacle spawning system, collision detection, camera system

---

#### **Jump & Slide Mechanics**

**Description:** Player can jump over low lasers or slide under high lasers. Timing is critical—misjudged inputs result in collision and trigger QTE recovery system.

**Player Input:**
- **SPACE / W / ↑** - Jump (vertical leap with arc)
- **SHIFT / S / ↓** - Slide (crouch/duck motion)
- Single press = full action (not hold-based)

**System Response:**
- **Jump:** Player sprite launches upward, follows parabolic arc, lands after ~0.8 seconds
- **Slide:** Player hitbox shrinks vertically for ~0.6 seconds, character sprite animates crouch
- Cannot jump while sliding or slide while jumping (actions lock until complete)
- Collision detection checks overlap between player hitbox and laser hitboxes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Arcade Physics for jump gravity and velocity
- Slide implemented as temporary hitbox resize + animation
- Coyote time (0.1s grace period after leaving ground) for forgiving jump timing
- Buffer input (0.15s) to queue next action during current action

**Performance Consideration:** Optimize hitbox calculations; use simple rectangles, not complex polygons

**Dependencies:** Animation system, collision detection, input manager

---

#### **Diamond Collection & Coding Challenges**

**Description:** Diamonds spawn in the corridor at varying heights and positions. Collecting a diamond pauses the game and presents a LeetCode-style coding challenge. Solving the challenge adds the diamond to the player's score.

**Player Input:**
- Run into diamond sprite to trigger collection
- Choose diamond tier strategically (risky placement = harder problems)

**System Response:**
- **White Diamond (◇):** Easy coding problem (arrays, strings, basic loops) - 1 point
- **Blue Diamond (◆):** Medium coding problem (hash maps, two pointers, recursion) - 3 points
- **Black Diamond (◆):** Hard coding problem (DP, graphs, advanced algorithms) - 10 points
- Game pauses when diamond collected
- Monaco Editor overlay appears with problem description, starter code, test cases
- Player writes JavaScript solution, submits for validation
- **Success:** Diamond added to score, game resumes at same speed/position
- **Failure:** Can retry unlimited times or forfeit diamond and resume
- **Forfeit:** Resume run without diamond (no penalty except lost points)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Diamonds spawn on predictable paths (high, mid, low) requiring jump/normal/slide to reach
- Each diamond has pre-assigned problem from problem pool (consistency for fairness)
- Visual distinction: different colors, particle effects, glow animations
- Code editor: Monaco Editor (desktop) with JavaScript syntax highlighting
- Sandboxed execution: Web Workers with timeout protection (prevent infinite loops)
- Test cases run automatically on submit; show pass/fail for each case

**Performance Consideration:** Lazy-load Monaco Editor on first diamond collected (heavy library)

**Dependencies:** Code editor library, JavaScript sandbox, problem database, test case validation system

---

#### **Laser Obstacle System**

**Description:** Laser beams appear as horizontal barriers at varying heights. Players must jump over low lasers or slide under high lasers. Collision triggers the quick-time event system.

**Player Input:**
- Visual observation to identify laser type (low vs high)
- Precise timing to execute jump or slide

**System Response:**
- **Low Laser:** Horizontal beam at ground level; requires jump to clear
- **High Laser:** Horizontal beam at head height; requires slide to duck under
- **Mid Laser:** No such thing—always clearly low or high for binary decision-making
- Lasers glow with red particle effects for high visibility
- Collision detection checks overlap between player and laser hitboxes
- On collision: Trigger QTE system (do not end run immediately)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Lasers spawn from obstacle pool at screen edge
- Move leftward at same speed as background scroll (creates illusion of player moving forward)
- Destroy lasers when they exit screen left (return to pool)
- Laser patterns: single lasers, double lasers (jump-slide combo), triple lasers (complex timing)
- Difficulty scaling: Increase laser density and pattern complexity over time

**Performance Consideration:** Limit active lasers on screen to 5-8 max; use object pooling

**Dependencies:** Collision system, QTE system, particle effects, obstacle spawner

---

#### **Quick-Time Event (QTE) Recovery**

**Description:** When player collides with a laser, instead of instant game over, a QTE appears. Player must replicate a displayed key sequence within 3-5 seconds to disarm the alarm and continue the run. Failure ends the game.

**Player Input:**
- Watch displayed key sequence (e.g., ← ↑ → ↓ A S)
- Replicate exact sequence within time limit

**System Response:**
- **Success:** "Alarm Disarmed!" message, brief invincibility (2s), resume run with all diamonds intact
- **Failure:** "Security Breach!" message, run ends, calculate final score, show leaderboard submission
- Visual feedback: Highlight correct/incorrect keys as player types
- Audio cues: Beep on correct key, buzzer on wrong key
- Timer countdown with progress bar

**Implementation Notes:**
- Pattern generation: 4-8 random keys (arrow keys + A/S/D/F)
- Difficulty scaling: Pattern length increases with player score (more diamonds = harder QTE)
- Early game: 4 keys, late game: 8 keys
- Input validation: Exact sequence match required; wrong key = instant fail
- Time pressure: 5 seconds early game, scales down to 3 seconds late game

**Performance Consideration:** Simple overlay UI; pause all background updates during QTE

**Dependencies:** Input detection system, UI overlay, game state pause/resume

### Economy & Resources

| Resource | How Earned | Purpose | Leaderboard Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **White Diamond (◇)** | Solve easy coding problem | Score points, build confidence | 1 point | Array, string, basic loop problems |
| **Blue Diamond (◆)** | Solve medium coding problem | Higher score, skill demonstration | 3 points | Hash maps, two pointers, recursion |
| **Black Diamond (◆)** | Solve hard coding problem | Maximum score, prestige | 10 points | Dynamic programming, graphs, advanced |
| **Distance Traveled (m)** | Continuous forward movement | Leaderboard ranking (tiebreaker) | Secondary metric | Measures endurance and consistency |
| **Run Duration (seconds)** | Survive without failing QTE | Achievement tracking | Tertiary metric | Used for speedrun challenges |

**Leaderboard Scoring Formula:**

```
Primary Score = (White × 1) + (Blue × 3) + (Black × 10)
Tiebreaker 1 = Distance Traveled (meters)
Tiebreaker 2 = Run Duration (seconds)
```

**Example Scores:**
- 10 White + 500m = 10 points, 500m
- 3 White + 4 Blue + 1 Black + 1200m = 3 + 12 + 10 = 25 points, 1200m
- 5 White + 5 Blue + 3 Black + 3500m = 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 points, 3500m

## Level Design Framework

### Procedural Generation System

**Purpose:** Create infinite, fair, and progressively challenging obstacle layouts

**Generation Rules:**

**Obstacle Spawning:**
- Spawn timer: Based on speed (faster = more frequent)
- Minimum gap between obstacles: 2 seconds at base speed, 0.8 seconds at max speed
- Laser types: 60% low (jump required), 40% high (slide required)
- Pattern types:
  - Single: 50% chance (one laser)
  - Double: 30% chance (jump → slide or slide → jump)
  - Triple: 20% chance (complex combo; only spawns after 1000m)

**Diamond Spawning:**
- White diamonds: Every 200-300m
- Blue diamonds: Every 400-600m
- Black diamonds: Every 800-1200m
- Placement tiers:
  - **Safe:** Diamond on ground level, no obstacles nearby
  - **Moderate:** Diamond requires jump or slide to reach, lasers before/after
  - **Risky:** Diamond between tight laser pattern, demands precise timing

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- Speed multiplier increases by 0.1x every 500m (caps at 2.5x base speed)
- Laser density increases: +10% spawn rate every 1000m
- Pattern complexity increases: More doubles/triples after 1000m
- QTE difficulty increases: +1 key every 5 diamonds collected (caps at 8 keys)

**Fairness Guarantees:**
- Always solvable: No patterns spawn that require impossible timing
- Reaction time: Minimum 0.6 seconds to react to new obstacle on screen
- No double-punish: After QTE recovery, 3 seconds of guaranteed safe corridor

- Audio can be sourced/created during Phase 2-3
- Problem database can be populated independently
- Obstacle patterns can be designed during Phase 1

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **If Monaco Editor proves too complex:** Fall back to simple textarea with basic syntax highlighting
- **If procedural generation is too difficult:** Use pre-built pattern sequences that loop
- **If performance issues arise:** Reduce particle effects, simplify shaders
